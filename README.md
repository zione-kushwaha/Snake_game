# Snake_game
I developed this program using python library i.e. pygame. In this program, The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Background music is also added for making it more enjoyable by all.
